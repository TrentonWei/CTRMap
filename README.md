# DorlingMap
An automatic algorithm for generation of a circular cartogram, namely DorlingMap, start coding~

#The Code is developed to support the findings of our submitted paper entitled “Cartogram is also a map Circular cartograms: via the elastic beam algorithm originated from cartographic generalization"，for more details see the pdf file as: waiting for our update 

#The tools were implemented in C# on ArcGIS 10.2 software (ESRI, USA). And the tool has a separate form to set the input, output and parameters for the algorithms.
